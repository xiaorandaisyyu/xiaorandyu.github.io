## Overview
I built a RISC-V simulator in SystemVerilog as part of my second year Instruction Architecture coursework. The coursework was completed in groups of four, and we received very high marks (A as team grade and A+ as individual grade). 

## Project Outline

The CPU we implemented had 3 levels of structural complexity: single-cycled, pipelined, and pipelined with data cache. The processor successfully ran a self-written F1 starting light program and a provided reference program. For more details please check our groupâ€™s repo.

## Personal Contribution

In the coursework, I was mainly responsible for implementing the top-level module of the CPU, writing the testbench, and peforming the verification of the processor with various programs. For more details please check my personal statement.
