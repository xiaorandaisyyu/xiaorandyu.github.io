## Overview
In my first year final project (Electronic Design Project), I worked closely with another 4 EIE students and 2 EEE students to design and build a remotely controlled rover which could manoeuvre around a simulated lunar landscape and identify the material composition of six types of rocks, distinguished by their differences in signal transmissions. Our project was evaluated in various perspectives (completeness, performance, robustness, usability, testability, maintainability, scalability, etc.), after which, our group received an overall mark of 69.50%.

## Project Outline
The goal was to design a remotely controlled rover that was able to identify different types of minerals from the signals emitted from them.

Sensors were made, which would detect magnetic fields, ultrasonic sound and radio waves and infrared radiation. These signals needed to be detected from a wide enough span around the rocks in order to effectively, exactly and efficiently scan the waves so that the materials were identified in the shortest time possible. 

Other factors, such as the power of the EEERoverâ€™s motors as well as accurate driving, precise turning, consideration of the wheels, and weight of the entire EEERover, were also taken into consideration.

Tests were conducted on the complete design, and a demonstration of the working rover on the artificial lunar landscape was successfully carried out.

## Personal Contribution
I mainly contributed in the developments of Arduino programs for the microcontroller, an iPhone APP for rover's movement and sensor controls, and the establishment of communications between rover and the APP. I also worked on the sensor circuit designs, including the integration of the PCB, with an EEE team member.
